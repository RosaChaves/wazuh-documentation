# How to install a manager on Mac for test purposes:

In Mac, just the wazuh agent can be installed. However, a Wazuh manager to whom the Wazuh agent would report is necessary.
Thus for the test purposes, installing a Virtual Machine such as Virtual Box is a solution.

* To install VirtualBox for Mac, please follow steps in the link <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>

* To configure Virtual Box, in Machine>Settings>Network select Attached to Bridget Adapter and Name (Wi-Fi)

* Once installed VirtualBox, importing a virtual image (OVA) that contains a wazuh manager along with the ELK . 
The user can find this image in : <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/virtual-machine.html>

* In File->Import, import the OVA in your virtualization platform and run the virtual machine. 
The wazuh-server login "root" and the password "wazuh"

* In the following path, /var/ossec/etc/ assure that there are the certificate <sslmanager.cert> and the key <sslmanager.key>

* In /var/ossec/bin/ run the following ./ossec-authd to start the authd server in the Manager

* Run ifconfig and get the server's IP

* Include the server's ip in etc/conf of the agent side

* in bin of agent's side  ./ossec-control restart
(mejor esto)
Library/Ossec/bin/agent-auth -m 192.168.0.160

* Visualize the logs in server side (in logs->head -n10000 ossec.log)

*Visualize the logs in the agent side /Library/Ossec/logs-->nano ossec.log
If it appears something like "agent-auth: INFO: Started (pid:11244)", connection is right
